## The studio

| Make it yours | What you can do |
| --- | --- |
| 🌈 **Lighting** | Colour individual keys, run hardware effects, and light the touchpad ring, lid emblem and power button. Save your favourite presets. |
| 🌡️ **Thermals** | Watch CPU/GPU temperatures and fan RPM, switch firmware profiles, and adjust fan boost in Custom mode. |
| 🔊 **Sounds** | Try Fart Lab, Gaming Keyboard or Freedom mode. Play inside FreeAlien or opt into background keyboard sounds. |
| 🎮 **Games** | Play Snake, Minesweeper, Zombie Defense and T-Rex with keyboard lighting. Snake also runs from the CLI. |
| 🛠️ **Automation** | Control lighting from the command line or build on the Python library. |

FreeAlien uses Linux **hidraw** for lighting, so the keyboard's HID driver stays
attached while you type. The desktop uses PyQt6; the lighting CLI and library use
Python's standard library.

## Get started

Clone the project and launch setup as your normal desktop user:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JafarAkhondali/FreeAlien.git
cd FreeAlien
./install.sh
```

Have **Python 3.10+ with curses** and **PyQt6** installed first. Setup uses
`sudo` and `udevadm`; thermal controls also need systemd and a supported
`alienware-wmi` driver. Setup does not download dependencies.

- **Ready by default:** desktop GUI, application-menu shortcut and thermal service.
- **Automatic:** lighting udev rules are installed and reloaded; no permission checkbox.
- **Optional:** launch at login, background keyboard access and reduced motion.
- **One-time administrator setup:** everyday lighting and thermal mode changes run
  from your normal account without sudo or password prompts.

Use **↑/↓** to move, **Space** to toggle, **/** to search and **Enter** to review.
Nothing is installed until you confirm. Deselect the thermal service if your
machine does not expose the supported driver.

Open **FreeAlien** from your application menu, or run:

```bash
~/.local/bin/freealien gui
```

Add `~/.local/bin` to `PATH` to use `freealien` directly. From a checkout,
`./freealien gui` runs the app without copying it.

<details>
<summary><strong>Sound dependencies, updates and removal</strong></summary>

Keyboard sound playback uses `libpulse-simple` with PulseAudio or PipeWire's
PulseAudio support. Background input on X11 uses `xinput`; native keyboard-access
setup in the GUI uses polkit (`pkexec`). Game audio optionally uses `paplay`,
`pw-play` or `aplay`.

Rerun `./install.sh` from an updated checkout to update the installed copy.
Keep the thermal service selected to update its privileged helper too.

Close FreeAlien and run `./uninstall.sh` to remove it. Presets and system
permissions/services are retained unless you select their removal. Uninstalling
does not reset firmware lighting or cooling settings.

See the [installation guide](packaging/README.md) for paths, services,
permissions and recovery.

## Compatibility

Developed and tested on the **Alienware m16 R2**. Other models may work if they
share these controllers; matching the brand alone does not establish support.

| Hardware | Supported surface |
| --- | --- |
| Darfon `0d62:d2b1` | Per-key RGB and keyboard hardware effects |
| AW-ELC `187c:0551` | Touchpad ring, lid emblem and power-button lighting |
| Linux `alienware-wmi` | Firmware thermal profiles, temperatures, fan RPM and fan boost where exposed |

The keyboard protocol addresses 92 LEDs; **85 correspond to physical keys on the
measured ANSI keyboard**. Thermal availability depends on the model, firmware and
kernel driver.

### Alienware 16 Area-51 (AA16250)

Reported working on the **Alienware 16 Area-51 AA16250** (keyboard `0d62:1bbc`,
chassis `187c:0551`). FreeAlien detects this model from its
DMI product name and adapts:

- **Keyboard:** per-key colour with the m16 layout (every key lit, in a row-by-row
  colour check), plus the Rainbow and Breathing effects. After running a hardware
  effect, per-key control is restored automatically.
- **Chassis:** the controller's zones are light IDs 0-40 here, so FreeAlien maps the
  touchpad (31-40), lid emblem (28), power button (27), rear bar (0-26) and fans
  (29-30). The GUI adds **Rear bar** and **Fans** parts on this model. The power
  button takes one colour; per-state AC and battery profiles and *persist* are not
  attempted.
- **CLI:** `freealien area51 purple` colours the keyboard and every chassis light;
  add `--part keyboard` or `--part chassis` to limit it.
- **Not verified here:** the other keyboard effects (side wave, double wave, morph,
  bounce), games, sounds and thermal controls.

Chassis lighting IDs came from visual testing on one laptop. Please report
differences on other Area-51 units.

G-Mode, automatic fan curves and CPU tuning are not implemented. Keyboard Pulse
and Laser effects are disabled because of unreliable behaviour. Some power-state
names and unobserved chassis zones remain unverified. See
[known gaps](docs/usage.md#known-gaps).

## A few commands

Run these from the checkout, or replace `./freealien` with your installed launcher:

```bash
./freealien status                     # check controller access
./freealien static purple              # colour the keyboard
./freealien key blue F1 F2 ESC          # colour selected keys
./freealien effect breathing purple    # hardware animation
./freealien touchpad green
./freealien logo white --persist       # retain the lid colour after reboot
./freealien power white purple         # AC / battery colours
./freealien snake
./freealien --dry-run static red       # inspect packets without sending them
```

The [user guide](docs/usage.md) covers effects, thermal controls, game shortcuts,
sounds, Python examples and the measured key layout. Use `./freealien --help`
for the full command list.

Thermal settings remain active after closing the GUI. Choose **Balanced** to
return to that firmware profile. Fan boost is a raw **0–255** value, not an RPM or
percentage; zero removes added boost and does not stop the fan.

Sounds start **off** and **inside FreeAlien**. Everywhere mode also detects
password-field presses; it cannot identify sensitive fields. FreeAlien does not
save typed text or show pressed-key names. Native keyboard permissions persist
after muting or quitting and allow other applications in your session to access
those keyboards. See [keyboard sounds](docs/usage.md#keyboard-sounds) for removal.

## Support the project

If FreeAlien is useful to you, **consider giving the repository a ⭐**.

Worked on your laptop? [Open an issue](https://github.com/JafarAkhondali/FreeAlien/issues)
and tell us your **exact laptop model/version**, Linux distribution and kernel,
and which features worked. Reports from other machines help improve the
compatibility information.
