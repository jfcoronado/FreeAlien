"""The AW-ELC chassis controller (187c:0551): touchpad, lid logo, power button.

Three separate surfaces, two of which behave the same way and one of which does
not.  Touchpad and lid logo are ordinary zones driven through the 0x21 animation
verbs.  The power button is a zone too (0x04) but its colours live in six standing
profiles under 0x22 that the firmware switches between on its own as the power
state changes -- so you do not set the power button's colour, you set the colour it
takes in each state.
