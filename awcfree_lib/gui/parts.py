"""What each lit part of the machine can actually do.

The panel shows one part at a time and offers only what that part supports, so this
table is the single place that knows the difference.  Keeping it here rather than
spread through the window means adding a surface later is a new entry, not a hunt
through the UI code.

The differences are real, not cosmetic:

* the keyboard is 85 individually addressable LEDs driven by the v5 protocol, and
  its effects run on the keyboard's own controller;
* the touchpad and the lid logo are single v4 zones that share one brightness
  control and one set of chassis effects;
* the power button has no colour of its own at all.  Its light is six stored
  profiles that the firmware chooses between as the power state changes, so the
  only meaningful thing to set is what colour it takes on AC and on battery.
